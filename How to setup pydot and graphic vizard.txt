How to setup pydot and graphic wizard.
Here is what you have to do it:

1. Install pydot from https://anaconda.org/rmg/pydot

2. Download graphic wizard from https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/Download/Download_windows.html

3. Install downloaded GraphicWizard

4. Add a line of code on top of the python script as below:
import os
os.environ["PATH"] += os.pathsep + 'C:/Program Files (x86)/Graphviz2.38/bin/'
This path is nothing but where you have download.

5. Restart Spyder and things should work! Stay classy.

#For any issues, Plz refer to:
As a reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18438997/why-is-pydot-unable-to-find-graphvizs-executables-in-windows-8

For me: (Win10, Anaconda3) Make sure you have done "conda install graphviz"

I have to add to the PATH: C:\Users\username\Anaconda3\Library\bin\graphviz

To modify PATH go to Control Panel > System and Security > System > Advanced System Settings > Environment Variables > Path > Edit > New

MAKE SURE TO RESTART YOUR IDE AFTER THIS. It should work
